## Abstract
Our project's main goal is to recognize constellations in pictures of the sky. The output will be the same image, but the stars that belong to the constellation will be highlighted. We'll use mainly Image Segmentation and Image Enhancement.

## Images

### Folders

We have separated the images in folders according to the constellation they show. Some of the constellations include:

-[Cancer](Images/Cancer) 

-[Gemini](Images/Gemini) 

-[Orion](Images/Orion)

-[Scorpius](Images/Scorpius) 


### Examples
Here are some exemples of the images that are going to be used to develop and test our project. Some pictures are easier to process and others are more complex.
